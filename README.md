**Chat:**

Currently, Talkyard is a mobile friendly web app.
Within half a year or a year (today is August 2018),
the plan is that there'll be a white labelled mobile app.
Meaning, people will be able to install your community, on their mobile phones,
as a separate app with your custom icon.
Push notifications for Android
(however, initially not for iPhone — iPhone currently cannot do PWA mobile app push notifications).

Contributing
-----------------------------

Want to contribute? Feel free to say hello in our community: <https://www.talkyard.io/forum/>.
Good for you if you ask the people there what is currently being worked on, so you won't
accidentally re-implement something that's almost done already — people
might be working in their own work-in-progress topic branches that you
don't know about.

Here's how to translate to a new language: [i18n-README](translations/i18n-README.md) (step 1 and 2 only).

You need to read and agree to our [Contributor License Agreement](./docs/CLA-v2.txt). You do that by
reading it (please do — there's a human friendly intro) and appending a single line
paragraph with your real name (no pseudonyms) and the following text, to all your commit messages:

> I, Your Full Name \<your@<i></i>email.address\>, agree to the Contributor License Agreement, docs/CLA-v2.txt.

Please squash your commits to just one (unless you're doing something complicated that's easier
to review in separate commits).




Getting Started
-----------------------------

This is for **development**. To install and *use* the software, instead go here:
[talkyard-prod-one](https://github.com/debiki/talkyard-prod-one)


#### Before you start

You need about 4 GB RAM for the development environment (whereas the production environment needs about 2 GB).
And a somewhat fast internet connection — you'll be downloading perhaps 0.5 (?) GB Docker images.

Install Docker and Docker-Compose, see: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/.
On Linux, you can:

```
sudo -i
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o install-docker.sh
sh install-docker.sh
curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.23.2/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
docker-compose --version  # should print "docker-compose version ... build ..."
```

Read [A brief intro to Docker-Compose](docs/intro-to-docker-compose.md) — unless you know
how to use docker-compose already.

#### The instructions


1. Append some settings to the system config so that ElasticSearch will work:
   (run this as one single command, not one line at a time)

       sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf <<EOF

       ###################################################################
       # Talkyard settings
       #
       # Up the max backlog queue size (num connections per port), default = 128
       net.core.somaxconn=8192
       # ElasticSearch requires (at least) this, default = 65530
       # Docs: https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt
       vm.max_map_count=262144
       EOF

    Reload the system config:

       sudo sysctl --system


1. Clone the repository, and type `make up`:  (you need GNU Make installed)

       apt install make
       git clone https://github.com/debiki/talkyard.git talkyard
       cd talkyard
       make up


1. Wait. `make up` takes a while: Git submodules and Node.js packages will get downloaded,
   Typescript, Stylus and Scala code gets compiled and packaged, Docker images get built. 
   You can tail the log messages, by typing `make tail`,
   or `sudo s/d logs -f`.  (s/d means "scripts" and "docker-compose")

   The following log message might take 10 - 20 minutes: (to download things)

       Loading project definition from /opt/talkyard/app/project

   Wait for these "Server started" log messages to appear:

       app_1     |
       app_1     | --- (Running the application, auto-reloading is enabled) ---
       app_1     |
       app_1     | [info] p.c.s.NettyServer - Listening for HTTP on /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:9000
       app_1     | [info] p.c.s.NettyServer - Listening for HTTPS on /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:9443
       app_1     |
       app_1     | (Server started, use Ctrl+D to stop and go back to the console...)
       app_1     |


1. Point your browser to http://localhost/. This sends a request to the Docker container
   named 'web', in which Nginx listens on port 80. Nginx sends the request to Play Framework
   in the 'app' container, port 9000. Play Framework then starts compiling more Scala files — this
   take a little while; the browser might show a 502 Bad Gateway error message.

   Soon, when done compiling, Play Framework will start. Then this gets logged:

       app_1  | [info] application - Starting... [TyMHELLO]
       ...
       ...
       app_1  | [info] application - Started. [TyMSTARTED]

   If you don't see these messages (maybe they scroll past too fast), you can
   continue with the next step just below anyway — just keep reloading the browser page until
   any "is starting" message in the browser window disappears.


1. Create a forum

   Reload the browser at http://localhost/. A page with a button should appear.
   Sign up as admin with this email: `admin@example.com` (must be that email).
   As username and password you can type `admin` and `public1234`.

<!-- Not needed any longer.
   You'll be asked to confirm your email address, by clicking a link in an email
   that was sent to you — but in fact the email couldn't be sent, because you haven't configured
   any email server, and `admin@example.com` isn't your address anyway.

   Instead look at the log messages. (Run `sudo docker-compose logs app` if you've closed
   the terminal with log messages.) There you'll find
   the email — it's written to the log files, in development mode. Copy the
   confirmation link from the `<a href=...>` and paste it in the browser's address bar.
   -->

Shut down everything like so: `make dead`.



Editing source code
-----------------------------

If you edit some code and reload the page in the browser, your changes will
appear automatically: there's a Docker container, named Gulp, with Node.js
installed, which recompile Typescript and Stylus CSS. And a container,
named App, which runs the Play Framework application server, and looks
for changes to Scala files, recompiles and reloads.

If you edit Typescript, wait five seconds before you reload the page in
the browser, otherwise the Typescript code might not yet have been transpiled.

If you keep editing and reloading Scala files many many times, then eventually
Play Framework runs out of memory. Restart it like so: `make restart`.



Building your own images
-----------------------------

Do this: (`make` is GNU Make)

```
vi version.txt    # type a new vesion number
vi .env           # change DOCKER_REPOSITORY to your own repository
make prod-images  # this runs tests and builds production images
make tag-and-push-latest-images tag=...  # pushes images to your repo
```

You can type `make` to see help about the Makefile targets.

All this has been tested in Ubuntu and Mint Linux only, with Bash. If you're
on Windows, probably you'll need [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com)
or [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org).

To use the images in your own Docker-Compose installation,
have a look here: https://github.com/debiki/talkyard-prod-swarm



About the images
-----------------------------

Here you can read about the various images in the Talkyard stack:
[about-the-talkyard-images.md](./docs/about-the-talkyard-images.md).



Troubleshooting
-----------------------------

See [tips.md](./docs/tips.md).



Tests
-----------------------------

#### End-to-end tests

The end-to-end tests are written in TypeScript and uses Selenium and Webdriver.io.
See the [end-to-end tests readme](./docs/e2e-tests-readme.md).
And, if you want to test in a browser other than Chrome, see [Making *.localhost addresses work](./docs/wildcard-dot-localhost.md).


#### Security tests

The security tests are written in TypeScript and use Tape = test-anything-protocol for Node.js.
See the [security tests readme](./docs/security-tests-readme.md).


#### Unit tests

Stop everything: `sudo docker-compose down` and then: `s/cli` then type `test` + hit Enter.


#### Performance tests

Install Scala SBT, see http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html. On Linux:

```
echo "deb https://dl.bintray.com/sbt/debian /" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt.list
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 2EE0EA64E40A89B84B2DF73499E82A75642AC823
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sbt
```

Append to `/etc/security/limits.conf` ... hmm but now with Docker-Compose, which container?

    your_login_name hard nofile 65535
    your_login_name soft nofile 65535

Configure very high max-requests-per-ip-per-second etc Nginx limits — otherwise during the performance
test Nginx will start to rate limit stuff and reply 503 Service Not Available:

```
sudo docker-compose  -f docker-compose.yml  -f docker-compose-no-limits.yml  up -d
```


Technology
-----------------------------

- Client: React.js, TypeScript, Webdriver.io.
- Server: Scala and Play Framework. Nginx, Nchan, some Lua. React.js in Java's Nashorn Javascript engine.
- Databases: PostgreSQL, Redis, ElasticSearch.

Naming style, tags and a new word
-----------------------------

### CSS classes and ids

*Example*: `s_P_By_FN-Gst`. Here, `s_` is a prefix used for all classes, and
it means "some". For ids we use `t_` instead, means "the". `P` means Post. `By` means
who-was-it-written-By. `FN` means Full Name. `Gst` means Guest.

So, this is BEM (Block Element Modifier) with a few tweaks: Blocks/elements are separated with
only one underscore, and modifiers with only one dash. Blocks, elems and modifiers always
start with uppercase — because then it's easy to tell if we're dealing with an _abbreviation_
or not. For example, `FN` (full name) is an abbreviation. But `By` is not (since it continues with
lowercase letters).

Another example: `s_Dfs_Df_Ttl` — this means the title (Ttl), of a draft (Df),
in a list of drafts (Dfs).  You'll find abbreviations like Ttl and Df, in
[bem-blocks.txt](./docs/bem-blocks.txt).

<!-- I think these short names actually improve readability, once you know what they means.
Seeing `s_Dfs_Df_Ttl` in the source code — that's brief and quick to read, doesn't steal
the attention from other things nearby you're probably more inteested in.
(too chatty, skip this)  -->

For stuff with otherwise no class or id, and that should be clicked in end-to-end tests,
we use classes only, and the prefix `e_` (instead of `s_` or `t_`).


### Single and double quotes

In Typescript (and any Javascript), use single quotes for strings the computer cares about,
like CSS classes or ids, e.g. `className: 's_P'` or `reactRenderMethod = 'hydrate'`,
or React component display names.
For texts that humans read, instead use double quotes, like: `Button({ ...}, "Undo")`.
When doing this, you can be fairly certain that if you edit a single quote string,
without knowing what you're doing, something will break.
Whilst if you edit a double quoted string and fix e.g. a spelling errors: the computer
won't care, but humans like it.


### Tag the code

Some parts of a software system, knows how other parts of the software system works,
sometimes in not-obvious ways. Make such otherwise hidden duplicated knowledge visible,
by tagging the code with tags like: `[1ABCDE2]`.
Example: `// Also done here: [4JKAM7] when deleting pages.`.
Or there's a 3rd partly lib bug workaround in one source code file, for a problem that happens
in a different file, and an end-to-end test that got affected, example: `[5QKBRQ]`.
Tag those three places with the same tag.
Just type a number, random uppercase letters, and another number, to create a tag.
And copy-paste it to where the related code is.


### Message codes and magic underscores

Log messages, and plain text messages sent back to the browser, start with `TyM` if it's
an info message, and `TyE` if it's an error. Like, `"Started. [TyMSTARTED]"` (a log message).

These messsage codes helps you instantly find the relevat source code, if there's
an error message anywhere. Otherwise, it can be terribly annoying,
when the browser says "Not found", and you have no idea where that message comes from.
For example, Nginx didn't find a location handler? Or a user is missing? Or a page? Or a post?
Or a client side route is missing? Or the hostname is wrong? Or ...?
And you search for "Not found" and find 1 000 matches.
Now, instead, you'll see `"Not found [TyE123ABC]"` — and you then search for "TyE123ABC"
and find the relevant source code.

Some message codes sent to the browser are checked for in end to end tests. They shall
have an underscore `_` at the *end* (because it's called *end* to *end* tests). So, if you see a
message code like: `"TyM0APPR_"` and you change it, you need to search for it
everywhere and update some end-to-end tests too.

Some message codes are checked for by production code Typescript, i.e. *front*end code.
They shall have a `_` at the beginnign (front) of the error code, and here's how they can be used
server side: `throwForbidden("_TyE403BPWD", "Bad username or password")` and
client side: `if (xhr.responseText.indexOf('_TyE403BPWD') ...`. — So, when you're looking at the
server side code the `_` tells you that the error code is used in the frontend Typescript code,
so you cannot just change it.


### Hen and henbirds

Source code comments should be concise, but writing "he or she" everywhere, when referring
to e.g. a user, becomes a bit verbose (because "he or she" is three words). There's
a short Swedish word that means "he or she", namely "hen". Let's start using it in English.

So: "hen" = either "he or she", or "him or her", depending on context.
And "hens" = "his or her", and "hen's" = "he or she is".

To refer to many hen = many-he-or-she, write "people". "Hens" however
means "his or her", just like "its" means, well, "its" (but not "things").

What about the bird previously called "hen"? Let's call it "henbird" instead.

So, hereafter, the word "hen" means "he or she". And the henbird, which I cannot
remember having mentioned or even thought about the past year, no longer gets
to occupy the short and useful word "hen".



Custom third party builds
-----------------------------

We're building & using a smaller version of Lodash, like so:
(this makes slim-bundle.min.js.gz 8kb = 4% smaller, as of September 2016)

    node_modules/lodash-cli/bin/lodash  include=assign,assignIn,before,bind,chain,clone,compact,concat,create,debounce,defaults,defer,delay,each,escape,every,filter,find,findLast,flatten,flattenDeep,forEach,forOwn,has,head,includes,identity,indexOf,isArguments,isArray,isBoolean,isDate,isEmpty,isEqual,isFinite,isFunction,isNaN,isNull,isNumber,isObject,isRegExp,isString,isUndefined,iteratee,keys,last,map,matches,max,min,mixin,negate,noConflict,noop,once,pick,reduce,remove,result,size,slice,some,sortBy,sumBy,take,tap,throttle,thru,toArray,uniq,uniqBy,uniqueId,value,values \
      --output client/third-party/lodash-custom.js

- For security reasons, we checkin only the resulting `.js` file (but not the `.min.js`) file
into source control (so that you can read the source code and see what it does).
- There are some Gulp plugins that builds Lodash but one seems abandonend (gulp-lodash-builder)
and the other (gulp-lodash-custom) analyzes all .js files, I guess that'd slow down the build
rather much + won't immediately work with Typescript?



Old Code
-----------------------------

In January 2015 I squashed all old 4300+ commits into one single commit,
because in the past I did some mistakes, so it feels better to start over again
from commit number 1. The old commit history is available here:
https://github.com/debiki/debiki-server-old
